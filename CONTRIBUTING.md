Do you feel like helping RexCord development? Did you found any bug that you would like to report the team? Do you have any suggestions for future RexCord features? Don't worry, the team would love to hear your suggestions and improvements!

***To start contributing:***

1. Create a fork of our [repository](https://github.com/Pedro12909/RexCord.git)

2. Check for bugs/issues on our [Issues](https://github.com/Pedro12909/RexCord/issues) page.

3. On your forked repo, create a new branch from dev.

4. Start coding.

5. When you think you're done, execute `mvn verify` in your favorite terminal.

6. If the build passes, commit it and create a pull request to our dev branch!

### Some important notes

1. RexCord uses Maven as a build tool. Get familiar with it at https://maven.apache.org

2. RexCord uses checkstyle to make sure all of it's code adheres to a certain coding standard. `mvn verify` is a great way of telling if your work is in line with our standards.

3. Maven's build MUST be successfull if you want your pull request to be accepted.

4. Properly test your changes before pushing them.

5. RexCord is being developed by a non-professional team. We are software engineering students and as such, our code may not be optimal. Feel free to post your suggestions on our Issues page. We are always striving to improve and learn!

6. Feel free to show up at our Discord for help.
